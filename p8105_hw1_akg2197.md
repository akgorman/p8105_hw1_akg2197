# Problem 0.1

# Problem 1

This dataset includes variables species (“species”), island (“island”),
bill length in mm (“bill_length_mm”), bill depth in mm
(“bill_depth_mm”), flipper length in mm (“flipper_length_mm”), body mass
in grams (“body_mass_g”), sex, and year.

The rows of the dataset are 344 The columns of the dataset are 8 The
mean flipper length is 200.9152047

# Scatterplot of bill length vs. flipper length

``` r
scatterplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm, 
  y = flipper_length_mm,
  color = species)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("bill_vs_flipper.png", scatterplot)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

la_df = tibble( norm_samp = rnorm(10), norm_samp_pos = norm_samp \> 0,
b_vec = c(“Q”, “W”, “E”, “R”, “T”, “Y”, “U”, “I”, “O”, “P”), level =
factor(c(“low”,“low”,“low”, “medium”,“medium”,“medium”,“medium”,
“high”,“high”,“high”)) )

mean(pull(la_df, norm_samp)) mean(pull(la_df, norm_samp_pos))
mean(pull(la_df, b_vec)) mean(pull(la_df, level)) \`\`\`

We have an error in pulling the level variable and taking the mean of a
character because it is non-numeric.
